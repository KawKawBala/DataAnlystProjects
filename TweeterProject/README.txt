- Once in the Tweetmeroteca, change your Hashtag and select the number of tweets from the slider. Click on "Search" once selection is done.

- Date will provide output based on the number of tweets selected so if goinf further on the past will provide no results.

- When changing to "Charts" and "Geo" allow the page to load, plots require rendering.
